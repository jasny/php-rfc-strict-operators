## FAQ

### What has been changed since the initial proposal?

  - Comparison operators `==`  `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` and `<=>` with
    non-numeric operands will throw a `TypeError`.
  - Variable parsing in strings specified in double quotes and with
    heredoc, is also affected.
  - Concatenation operation (using `.`) on `null` does not throw a
    `TypeError`, but will cast `null` to an empty string.

### Why does `==` and `!=` only support int and float operands

The main difference between the equal (`==`) and identical (`===`) operator,
is that `==` doesn't perform type casting. By only disabling type casting
with strict_operators, `==` would be similar to `===` for scalar types.

This RFC tries to avoid behaviorial changes based on the strict_operators
directives.

The `==` and `!=` operators compares two arrays as unsorted hashmaps. This
is a useful feature. However, it's currently tied in with type juggling.
Comparing the values of the array with type checking, similar to `===`,
would significatly change the behavior of an operation based on the
strict_operators directive. Example; `['a' => null] == ['a' => 0]` would
result in `true` when the strict_operators is enabled and `false`
otherwhise.

The `==` and `!=` operators compares two objects by property. This is tied
in with type juggling. Similar to arrays, comparing property values with
`===` would change the behavior of the `==` operation.

Comparing two numeric strings using `==` and `!=` will compare them as
numbers. Disabling type juggling would change this behavior and make these
operators the same as `===` and `!===` in this case.

### Why don't comparison operators support strings?

In many other languages, using `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `=>` with
string operands performs an `strcmp` like operation. The `<=>` is even
described as strcmp as operators. Why do these operators throw an
exception with string operands when strict\_operators is enabled?

It's common to use these operators when both operands are numeric
strings. Having these statements return a different value based on the
directive, could lead to issues, especially when source code is
copy/pasted from an external codebase.

In case it concerns comparing text, it's better to use
`Collator::compare()`. For non-collation related strings, like date
strings, the `strcmp` function should be used.

_Nikita Popov made the following argument:_

> writing `$str1 < $str2` is a bug and should generate a `TypeError`. Of
> course, equality comparisons like `$str1 == $str2` should still work,
> similar to the distinction you make for arrays.

### Why does the concatenation operator cast, but arithmetic operators don't?

The concatenation operator will cast integers, floats and *(when
`__toString` is defined)* objects to a string. This is a common use case
and operands are always typecasted to a string. Integers and floats
always have a proper string representation.

Arithmetic operators won't cast strings to an integer or float, because
not all strings can be properly represented as a number and a
`TypeError` must be thrown based on the operand type only, not the
value.

Both the concatenation operator and arithmetic operators throw a
`TypeError` for arrays, resources, and objects. Casting these to a
string or int/float doesn't give a proper representation of the value of
the operand.

Using a boolean or null as operand for both concatenation and arithmetic
operators also throws a `TypeError`. In most cases, the use of a boolean
or null indicates an error as many functions return `false` or `null` in
case of an error or when no result can be returned. This is different
from the function returning an empty string or `0`.
[`strpos`](https://php.net/strpos) is a well-known example.

### Will comparing a number to a numeric string work with strict_operators?

No, this will throw a `TypeError`. Users that use string operators need
to explicitly typecast the string to an integer. If it concerns input
data, for instance from `$_POST`, it's recommended to use the [filter
functions](https://www.php.net/filter).

### How can arrays be compared as unsorted hashmaps?

Arrays are sorted hashmaps in PHP but used as any type of collection
like unsorted maps, lists, and sets. Only comparing as unsorted hashmap
is supported using `==`, while other cases require the use of functions
like `sort()` and `array_values()`.

Strict comparison of arrays as unsorted hashmaps currently isn't
possible and requires sorting the array, prior to comparison.

With `==` unavailable when using strict_operators, sorting the array
would be the only option available.

Array functions might be added to compare arrays in different ways. But
that's outside the scope of this RFC.

### Why isn't is allowed to increment strings with strict\_operators?

Nikita Popov made the following argument:

> String increment seems like a pretty niche use case, and I
> believe that many people find the overflow behavior quite surprising. I
> think it may be better to forbid string increment under
> strict\_operators.

### Are built-in functions affected by strict\_operators?

No. Only operators (including the `case` statement) in the source file
that has `declare(strict_operators=1)` are affected. Functions defined
elsewhere, including functions defined in extensions, are not affected.

Specifically `sort()` and `in_array()` will apply type jugging by default
and require the use of the `$sort_flags` and `$strict` arguments
to change the way the values are compared.

### Can relational operators be allowed for arrays?

If both arrays must have the same keys in the same order, using `<` or
`>` on two arrays can be useful. But, as shown in the examples, when
this is not the case, these type of comparisons will yield unexpected
results.

Throwing a `TypeError` only if the keys of the arrays don't match is not
in line with this RFC. The behavior of an operator should not depend on
the value of the operand, only on the type. Furthermore, a `TypeError`
would be misplaced here, as some arrays would be accepted but others
not, whereas a `TypeError` indicates no values of that type are
accepted.

### Are there cases where a statement doesn't throw a TypeError but yields a different result?

No, not for operators.

If the secorndary vote for strict comparison with `switch` is accepted,
`switch` can give a different result.

### Will this directive disable type juggling altogether?

No. Operators can still typecast under the given conditions. For
instance, the concatenation (`.`) operator will cast an integer or float
to a string, and boolean operators will cast any type of operand to a
boolean.

Typecasting is also done in other places: `if` and `while` statements
interpret expressions as boolean, and booleans and floats are cast to an
integer when used as array keys.

This RFC limits the scope to operators.

### Why is switch affected? It's not an operator.

Internally the `case` of a switch is handled as a comparison operator.
The issues with `case` are therefore similar to those of comparison
operators. The audience that strict_operators caters to, may want
to get rid of this behavior completely.

This is determined by a secondary vote.
